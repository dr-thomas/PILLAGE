Particle Identification Learning for Low Energy Argon Gas Events (PILLAGE)

A combination of a Random Sample Consesus (RANSAC) based clustering algorithm for idetifying short, 
linear tracks and a Neural Net for particle ID classifiaction and observable regression on the RANSAC'd tracks.  

Install notes:
depends on RANSAC.  need to do: 
$ git submodule update --init RANSAC

the MLP directory contains examples of how to train a multi-layer preceptron from GArSoft analysis files
